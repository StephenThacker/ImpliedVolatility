This script infers the implied volatility surface by numerically approximating a solution to the Black-Scholes model for sigma. The script pulls in data from Yahoo Finance's API and uses an analytically derived form of Vega, with the Raphson-Newton root finding method, to solve for the implied volatility.
Please note that this implied volatility is only an approximation, as analytical solutions do not exist for American Styled options and results are best near the money. Moreover, this approximation works best for low/no dividend
yield stocks. Checking a few examples and comparing to publicly published implied volatility numbers, the model performs well under these constraints. Moreover, running the script on a few companies with upcoming earnings, 
you can see that the implied volatility surface is capturing the market's anticipation of a movement. The implied volatility curve was computed on October 17th, 2025, with the upcoming earnings reflected with the elevated ridge. Infeasible solutions, such as outliers, negative volatilities and non-convergent sigmas are filtered from appearing on the surface.
